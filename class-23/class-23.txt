Hey @everyone 

Thanks for digging deep and pushing through some tough topics tonight! Local Storage and dealing with complex APIs is NOT EASY!

Remember, NO CLASS THURSDAY. Instead of class, I'm going to ask that you fill out a survey, work on crafting your story,  and buff your resume before Friday's class.  I'll share links / resources on Thursday. 

Also, now that we have partner and can risk being more experimental with our extra classes, without the risk of losing quality settings. What would you like to see? More review, more projects, more push, more office hours...? Please think through what you would like to see for #100Devs and be ready to share in the survey on Thursday! Thank you!

Hey @everyone 

:pikahello:  REMINDER: NO CLASS TONIGHT! I'm picking up "The Machine"!

:bob: Please make Bob proud, however, by doing the following instead of class:

1. Fill out this survey: https://forms.gle/PBQSj19yzby14tir8
👆🏾 I really want to work hard over break to make class and #100Devs the best it can be! Please fill out this quick survey, so I can make things better, more fun, and more engaging! 

2. If you missed our last resume class, please catch up and watch here (shorter than normal class):  https://www.twitch.tv/videos/893268880

3. Finally, please start to think about your story. How do your past experiences make you a better candidate for any software engineering role? We'll talk more about this tomorrow!
