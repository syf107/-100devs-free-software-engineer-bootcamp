Hey @everyone 

Thanks for making the nerds angry and diving into OOP. I really hope it helped you think about WHY encapsulation and abstraction might be useful!

We're gonna try something different for our Crafting Your Story Class tonight by using Remo. This will make it easier for me to bring brave souls up to craft their story live. 

Join us at 6:30pm EST here: https://live.remo.co/e/100devs-crafting-your-story-nigh

We'll talk about how to craft your story, do a few live, and then leave time for folx to practice either 1 on 1 or in small groups!

See you soon!
