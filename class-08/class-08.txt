Hey @everyone 

 This is a hard message to send, but this past week and especially today has been super rough mental health wise for me. I don't have the energy to give our first JS lecture the love it deserves. So instead of class tonight, we'll have our "icebreaker meet your housemates event part 2" that a lot of folx have been asking for to kick off our first week of networking! Let's work out the awkwardness and practice meeting new folx together tonight! 

Our first JS lecture will be on Thursday and all work will be due then. While you are waiting for or after your house meet and greet, please make your layouts better! Also, today is #givingTuesday, so I would really appreciate if you could like and retweet this instead of checking in tonight: https://twitter.com/leonnoel/status/1333896543967952902

Hamilton will meet at 6:30pm EST here (FIRST 200 - sorry, site max): https://icebreaker.video/events/U9BmGUHBO4Q5HMDhGDEP

Hopper will meet at 7:15pm EST here: https://icebreaker.video/events/U3aXEZDAGhRw1Tjc7pIs

Turing will meet at 8:00pm EST here: https://icebreaker.video/events/ex9Wzbp5qPb3Dhr5osF2

Each Meet & Greet will be 45mins. Mic & Camera is required for the site to work and the site works well on phones too. 

Looking forward to spending some time with you all this evening!
