@everyone Shout out to everyone that YOLOed some channel points tonight! Hope you had some fun and started to see the power of OBJECTS! We didn't get to everything, so we're going to continue class on Saturday in combination to office hours. Don't worry if you can't make it, we'll review on Tuesday and the VOD will be posted to https://leonnoel.com/youtube

We'll bump the homework to Thursday, since we didn't get to everything today. Please jump into your codewars and #deleted-channel will start again on Monday. 

Also, please remember Health First as things get spicy!
